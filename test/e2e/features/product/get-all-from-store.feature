Feature: Get all the products from Store
    In order to get the products from a store in the platform
    As a anon user
    I want to get all the product from a store

    #Scenario: A valid request
        #Given I send a GET request to "/store/47d4de83-a17c-4e99-8f52-35e539bf5ed7/product"
        #Then the response should be visible in the console
        #And the response status code should be 200
